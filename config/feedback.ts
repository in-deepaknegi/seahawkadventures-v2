        comment: "I had two amazing river rafting experiences with Sea Hawk Adventures in Rishikesh.\n\nThe first trip was during summers in June 2024, where I went with 7 friends for a 75 km rafting expedition. Initially planned as a 3-day, 105 km journey, it was shortened to 2 days due to high water levels, but it was still thrilling. Our raft guide, Sandeep Rana and kayak guide, Nitesh Negi was not only incredibly skilled but also hilarious, keeping us entertained throughout the trip with his sense of humour. During this expedition, we had the unique experience of spending about 60% of the time floating in the river without raft, and we also jumped into many rapids, which was both thrilling and exhilarating!\nStay and food during this trip was also great.\nThey ensured a safe and exciting adventure.\n\nThe second trip was in first week of January 2025, when I returned with 10 friends and cousins for a 35 km rafting experience on cold chilly water. Guides on two rafts, Manish and Rohit were great and Nitesh once again added fun to the adventure with his lively personality.\nThe food served was delicious, adding to the overall enjoyment.\n\nBoth times, the experience was unforgettable, and I highly recommend Sea Hawk Adventures for anyone looking to explore the Ganga River in Rishikesh. Special thanks to Rishi, the owner, for being very helpful!",

From the moment we arrived, the team was incredibly professional, friendly, and safety-conscious. Our guides were experienced and enthusiastic, providing clear instructions and making sure everyone felt comfortable throughout the journey.\n\nThe rapids were exhilarating, and the scenery was breathtaking. We encountered some challenging sections, but our guides handled them with skill and kept the mood fun and exciting. We even had the opportunity to swim in some natural pools and enjoy the stunning surroundings.\n\nSeahawk Adventures clearly prioritize safety and customer satisfaction. They provided all the necessary equipment, and their attention to detail was impressive. I highly recommend Seahawk Adventures to anyone looking for an adrenaline-pumping and unforgettable whitewater rafting adventure.",
