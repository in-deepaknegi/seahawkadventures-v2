    overview: `<p>Rafting from Marine Drive to Shivpuri- Rishikesh is called 12km rafting. It features roughly seven rapids, both minor and large. Black money(II), Three blind mice(III), Cross fire(III), and body surfing are some of the good rapids we run on this stretch. Although there are some large waves and hydraulics, these rapids are safe to raft. The travel to the starting place takes about 30 minutes to an hour, followed by another 30 minutes for preparation, raft inflation, and safety training. We board the rafts when the safety briefing is completed. It's a two-hour river adventure with plenty of splashes and powerful hits.</p>
