    overview: `<p>Rafting from Shivpuri to NIM beach- Rishikesh is called 16km by every operator in Rishikesh but in actual it is not 16km. It is around 11-12km by River and takes around 1 and half to 2 hours to complete. It features roughly seven rapids, both minor and large. Roller Coaster (III+), Golf Course (III+), and Club House are some of the good rapids we run on this stretch (III). Although there are some large waves and hydraulics, these rapids are safe to raft. The travel to the starting place takes about 30 minutes to an hour, followed by another 30 minutes for preparation, raft inflation, and safety training. We board the rafts when the safety briefing is completed. It's a two-hour river adventure with plenty of splashes and powerful hits.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>We complete our rafting excursion just before Laxman Jhula and then drive back to the Sea Hawk Adventure office in 5 minutes.</p>`,
