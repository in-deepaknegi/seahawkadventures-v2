                    This river rafting trip lasts about two hours and can be quite challenging due to the strong currents of the Ganges River and some steep rapids along the way. This particular stretch of river is the most popular for rafting in Rishikesh, attracting many thrill-seekers looking for an unforgettable experience on the water.
